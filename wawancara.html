According to Mr Sofyan Sauri, camphor is an aromatic compound formed from 2 benzene rings called naphthalene. besides used as camphor, camphor can also be mixed with motor vehicle fuel to add octane number of the fuel. so that the performance of the motor vehicle increases. Because camphor has toxic nature, therefore camphor distribution and users should be stored in dry place and away from children.
