<p><h3>Toenail fungus (onychomycosis)</h3> Preliminary research suggests that camphor, in combination with lemon eucalyptus oil and menthol, applied to the toenail area, might be useful for treating toe nail fungus. Applying chest rub products containing camphor such as Vicks VapoRub to affected toenails daily until the infected nail grows out appears to clear fungal nail infections in some people.</p>

<p><h3>Low blood pressure after standing up</h3> Early resrach suggests that taking a specific product containing camphor and hawthorn (Korodin-Herz-Kreislauf-Tropfen) by mouth helps prevent big drops in blood pressure upon standing. However, it is not clear if taking camphor alone provides the same benefits, and this product is not available in the US.</p>
