<p>Likely Effective :</p>
	<p>Cough. Camphor is FDA-approved as a chest rub in concentrations less than 11%.</p>
	<p>Pain. Camphor is FDA-approved for use on the skin as a painkiller in concentrations of 3% to 11%. It is in many rub-on products for cold sores, insect stings and bites, minor burns, and hemorrhoids.</p>
    <p>Skin itching or irritation. Camphor is FDA-approved for use on the skin to help itching or irritation in concentrations of 3% to 11%.</p>
<p>Possibly Effective :</p>
	<p>Osteoarthritis. A rub-on cream containing camphor, glucosamine sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate seems to reduce the severity of symptoms of osteoarthritis by about half. Researchers believe it is probably the camphor, not the other ingredients, that relieves the symptoms.</p>
<p>Insufficient Evidence :</p>
	<p>    Toenail fungus (onychomycosis). Preliminary research suggests that camphor, in combination with lemon eucalyptus oil and menthol, applied to the toenail area, might be useful for treating toe nail fungus. Applying chest rub products containing camphor such as Vicks VapoRub to affected toenails daily until the infected nail grows out appears to clear fungal nail infections in some people.</p>
    <p>Low blood pressure after standing up. Early resrach suggests that taking a specific product containing camphor and hawthorn (Korodin-Herz-Kreislauf-Tropfen) by mouth helps prevent big drops in blood pressure upon standing. However, it is not clear if taking camphor alone provides the same benefits, and this product is not available in the US.</p>
    <p>Warts.</p>
    <p>Hemorrhoids.</p>
