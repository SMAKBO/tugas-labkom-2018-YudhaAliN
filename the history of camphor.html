<h1>Champor or Kapur Barus in Indonesian that comes from the sap of a tree that has lived for hundreds of years. The term 'camphor' comes from the word 'karpoor' or in Arabic 'kafur' which in our language is absorbed into 'chalk'. </h1>
<h2>Camphor was first synthesized by Gustaf Komppa in 1903. Previously, some organic compounds (such as urea) had been synthesized in the laboratory as a proof of concept, but camphor was a scarce natural product with a worldwide demand. The synthesis was the first industrial total synthesis, when Komppa began industrial production in Tainionkoski, Finland, in 1907. And then, after a while, Marco Polo noted that camphor oil was highly valued by the Chinese as a medicine, scent, and embalming fluid.</h2>
<h3>In Indonesia, camphor was found in the wood plants, Laurel Kamper tree (Cinnamomum camphora). This large tree can be found in Asia, especially in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Taiwan. Camphor can also be tapped from other types of trees from the laurel family, such as Ooticaa usambarensis, dried rosemary leaves (Rosmarinus officinalis), and other mint family also contain up to 20% camphor.  </h3>
