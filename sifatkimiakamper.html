1.Oxidation? Aldehydes and Ketones</div>
Tollen’s test chiefly used for the detection of aldehydes.

Tollen’s reagent does not attack carbon-carbon double bonds.

Strong Oxidants: Ketones resist mild oxidation, but with strong oxidants at high temperature they undergo cleavage of C – C bonds on either sides of the carbonyl gorup.</p>
<br>
2.Aldol Condensation
Substrate  : aldehyde or ketone containing a hydrogen

Reagent    : Dilute Base

Product    : ß-hydroxyaldehyde or b-hydroxyketone

Under the influence of dilute base or dilute acid, two molecules of an aldehyde or ketone may combine to form a b-hydroxy aldehyde or ketone.

The a-carbanion generated by the base from one molecule of ald. Or ketone adds to the carbonyl carbon of the other molecule and the two molecules condense and form b-hydroxy aldehyde or ketone. Let us consider the mechanism for the OH catalysed aldol condensation of acetaldehyde.Aldol condensations are reversible, and with ketones the equilibrium is unfavourable for condensation product. b-hydroxycarbonyl compounds are readily dehydrated to give a-b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. With Ar on b-carbon, only dehydrated product is isolated.</p>
<br>
3. Crossed Aldol Condensation
An aldol condensation between two different carbonyl compounds so called crossed aldol condensation – is not always useful as a mixture of four different possible products may be obtained.

Under certain condition, a good yield of a single product can be obtained from a crossed aldol condensation. One reactant contains no a-hydrogens and therefore is incapable of condensing with itself (eg. Aromatic aldehydes or formaldehyde).</p>
<br>
4. Cannizzaro Reaction
Discussion: In the presence of concentrated alkali, aldehydes containing no - a-hydrogens undergo self-oxidation and reduction to yield a mixture of an alcohol and a salt of a carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as Cannizzaro – reaction.

Two successive additions are involved.

a)  Addition by hydroxide ion in first step

b) Addition of hydride ion in the next step.

This explains the Crossed Cannizzario reaction involving formaldehyde to take place in the way that it does.

ArCHO + HCHO → HCO2Na+ + ArCH2OH

On both electronic and steric grounds, the step 1 is faster for HCHO. Hence becomes the hydride donor in the next step.
<br>
5. Claisen Condensation,Formation of b-Keto Esters
An a–hydrogen in an ester, like an a-hydrogen in an aldehyde or ketone, is weakly acidic, because, the carbonyl group helps to accommodate the negative charge of the carbanion.

When ethyl acetate is treated with sodium ethoxide, and the resulting mixture is acidified ethyl 3–oxobutanoate, generally known as ethyl acetoacetate or acetoacetate or acetoacetic ester is obtained.

it can be concluded that camphor has a danger that threatens human health. Therefore, we must use it safely. Here's how to use camphor safely.

1. Avoid as much as possible from the reach of children, especially toddlers who easily swallow objects that look interesting and colorful. In addition, avoid babies from exposure to camphor.
  <br>
2. In baby wardrobe, no need to use fragrance from camphor. The reason, because chemicals in camphor can trigger the rupture of red blood cells and increase levels of bilirubin in the baby's blood.
<br>
3. For you who have sensitive skin, you should place camphor in a container, or wrapped with tissue. This is to minimize direct exposure to your clothes and trigger allergic reactions or skin irritation.
<br>
4. In order to avoid you from the risk of health problems, do not take too long in the smell of camphor. Use in moderation and keep it out of reach of pets.
<br>
According to data cited from the Food and Drug Supervisory Agency (BPOM), camphor is harmful to human health and safe to use for everyday purposes.
Based on history, camphor is made from wood chopped pieces of Cinnamomum Camphora tree which grow in Barus area, West Sumatera. But as the times progressed, the Kamfer tree became increasingly rare in the forests of the Barus region.
And moth balls we meet today, synthesized from turpentine oil and mixed with chemicals. Well, chemicals that give negative impact if used in excessive amounts.
