Camphor is a  bicyclic ketone widely distributed in nature, especially in trees of the Far East. Camphor can be made from secondary alcohol oxidation reactions with the help of Sodium Hypochlorite. In this experiment you will oxidize the alcohol group in isoborneol to the ketone group in camphor using sodium hypochlorite:

			EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
1. Dissolve 5 g of isoborneol in 15 mL of glacial acetic acid in a 125-mL Erlenmeyer flask.  

2. Add 50 mL of bleach by the mL over 5 minutes, cooling the flask as necessary to keep the internal temperature in the range 15-25ÂºC. Allow the mixture to stand   at room temperature for one hour with occasional swirling.  

3. Test the solution with KI-starch paper.  A positive test, for excess chlorine should be obtained.  Formation of a blue-black color on the test paper is a positive test. 

4. Add saturated NaHSO3 solution carefully until the yellow color of the reaction mixture disappears and the KI-starch test is negative (no blue-black color).

5. Pour the mixture over 100 mL of brine and ice, collect the solid by filtration on a Buchner funnel, and wash it with saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution until foaming is no longer evident.  Press the solid as dry as possible on the funnel.  

6. Dissolve the solid in 20 mL of methylene chloride, separate any water layer if one appears, and dry the solution over anhydrous sodium sulfate. 

7. After filtering the drying agent, boil off the methylene chloride in a hot-water bath in the hood. Camphor is quite volatile, so be careful not to 
overheat or some of your product will be lost. 

8. Weigh the product and determine the theoretical, actual and percentage yield of camphor. 

9. Prepare the 2,4-Dinitrophenylhdrazone derivative of your product to prove you made camphor.  Dissolve about 0.2 g of your crude camphor in 5 mL of 95% ethanol, add 10 mL of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent solution, heat to boiling on a hotplate for 3 minutes, and allow the mixture to cool.  Add water dropwise until the turbidity just clears. 

10. Crystallization usually occurs within a few minutes.  Filter the yellow precipitate by suction, wash with 2-3 mL of water, and allow drying to occur.  Determine the melting point.  Compare the melting point of your derivative to that found in the CRC Handbook of Tables for Organic Compound Identification
found on the shelf at the back of the laboratory.  
You will find this information in Table X. Organic Derivatives of Ketones [part b)Solids].  In this table the derivativesvare listed under the name of the ketone and are listed in order of increasing melting point. 



Camphor or 'Kapur Barus' is usually used as a fragrance. camphor fragrances can be made at home, here are the steps.

1. Prepare the mold (prints). Coat the mold with wax paper so that the waxy side is facing up. 
2. Pour the paint into the bowls. You will need two tablespoons of paint for each group.
3. Add the cast. Spoon half a glass of casts into each bowl. Mix well until all ingredients are mixed and there are no blobs.
4. Add a drop of dishwashing liquid soap. This makes it easier to chalk to clean. Add one or two drops into each bowl and stir until evenly distributed.
5. Pour the chalk mixture into the mold. Cover the prints with wax paper when you are done.
6. Allow to dry. Place in a dry place and let it dry all night. Camphor can be used after being completely dry.
