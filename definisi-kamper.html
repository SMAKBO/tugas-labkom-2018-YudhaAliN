<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16pt; color: #00802b; text-align: justify;"> Camphor is crystalline solid white and little bit transparent ketone. camphor has a strong and unique aroma. camphor is a volatile substance, easy to sublimate and flammable. this substancehas the chemical formula C10H16O. </p>


<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16pt; color:#00802b; text-align: justify; ">The camphor's IUPAC name is 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2-one. champor molar mass = 152,24 g/mol, density = 0.992 g.cm−3, boiling point = 209 °C (408 °F; 482 K) and melting point = 175–177 °C (347–351 °F; 448–450 K). Camphor is practically insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, and other solvents. The alcoholic solution is known as spirits of camphor. in biosyntesis, camphor is produced from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclisation of linanool pyrophospate to bornylpyrophosphate, followed by hydrolisis toborneol and oxidation to camphor. here's the reaction. </p>



<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16pt; color: #00802b; text-align: justify; ">Camphor is found in the wood of the camphor laurel which is Cinnamomum Camphora (a large tree found in Asia, especially in Sumatra, Borneo and Taiwan) and Dryobalanops Aromatica (a large tree grown in the forests of Borneo). camphor can also be tapped from other types of trees from the laurel family, such as Ocotea Usambarensis. the mint plant also contains up to 20% camphor. this substance is usually used as a fragrance, as a food spice (only in india), for the purposes of drugs, chemicals, or religious ceremonies. A major source of champhor in Asia is champor basil (the parent of Afican blue basil).

Camphor can cause skin allergies, inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, dizziness, lethargy and unconsciousness, because of that, we have to store the camphor carefully. we have to store camphor separated from strong oxidants, strong reducing agents, chlorinated solvents and food and feedstuffs. Well closed. Ventilation along the floor. Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities: keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place.
more details will be explained in a chapter of camphor hazards.</p>
